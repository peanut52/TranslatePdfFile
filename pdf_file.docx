Predicting Volatility
Stephen Marra, CFA, Senior Vice President, Portfolio Manager/Analyst
Uncertainty is inherent in every financial model. It is driven by changing fundamentals, human psychology, and the 
manner in which the markets discount potential future states of the macroeconomic environment. While defining uncer-
tainty in financial markets can quickly escalate into philosophical discussions, volatility is widely accepted as a practical 
measure of risk. Most market variables remain largely unpredictable, but volatility has certain characteristics that can 
increase the accuracy of its forecasted values. The statistical nature of volatility is one of the main catalysts behind the 
emergence of volatility targeting and risk parity strategies.
Volatility forecasting has important implications for all investors focused on risk-adjusted returns, especially those that 
employ asset allocation, risk parity, and volatility targeting strategies. An understanding of the different approaches used 
to forecast volatility and the implications of their assumptions and dependencies provides a robust framework for the 
process of risk budgeting.
In this paper, we will examine the art and science of volatility prediction, the characteristics which make it a fruitful 
endeavor, and the effectiveness as well as the pros and cons of different methods of predicting volatility.2

Predicting Volatility
Stephen Marra, CFA, Senior Vice President, Portfolio Manager/Analyst
Uncertainty is inherent in every financial model. It is driven by changing fundamentals, human psychology, and the 
manner in which the markets discount potential future states of the macroeconomic environment. While defining uncer-
tainty in financial markets can quickly escalate into philosophical discussions, volatility is widely accepted as a practical 
measure of risk. Most market variables remain largely unpredictable, but volatility has certain characteristics that can 
increase the accuracy of its forecasted values. The statistical nature of volatility is one of the main catalysts behind the 
emergence of volatility targeting and risk parity strategies.
Volatility forecasting has important implications for all investors focused on risk-adjusted returns, especially those that 
employ asset allocation, risk parity, and volatility targeting strategies. An understanding of the different approaches used 
to forecast volatility and the implications of their assumptions and dependencies provides a robust framework for the 
process of risk budgeting.
In this paper, we will examine the art and science of volatility prediction, the characteristics which make it a fruitful 
endeavor, and the effectiveness as well as the pros and cons of different methods of predicting volatility.2
